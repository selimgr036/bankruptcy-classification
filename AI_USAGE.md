# AI Tool Usage Documentation

This document describes how AI tools were used in the development of this bankruptcy prediction project.

## AI Tools Used

I used **Copilot** and **ChatGPT** as coding assistants throughout this project for:

- **Code refactoring**: Improving code structure and organization
- **Code reviewing**: Reviewing code for bugs, best practices, and improvements
- **Documentation**: Generating and improving documentation (README, docstrings, comments)
- **Debugging**: Identifying and fixing errors, compatibility issues, and bugs

All code was reviewed and understood before integration, and the final implementation reflects the project requirements.
